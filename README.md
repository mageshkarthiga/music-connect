### Cron Job to populate events and tracks

Two services are used in this system: one written in Go and the other in Python.
The Go service includes a scheduled job that runs every Sunday at 00:00. This job performs two tasks:

- Calls the Spotify API to check for and store any newly released tracks.

- Triggers the Python Scraper service, which scrapes Ticketmaster for new events and returns the data to be stored.

To setup:

1. Open 2 terminals. In the first terminal, go to the `ticketmaster scraper` service directory:

   ```bash
   cd ticketmaster-scraper
   ```

2. Run the service:

   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```

3. In the second terminal, go to the `cron-jobs` service directory:

   ```bash
   cd cron-jobs
   ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```go
   go mod tidy
   ```

5. Build and run the service:

   ```go
   go build
   go run .
   ```
